# BCurrent task: build Kernel.
# I have a very basic kernel defined here, but need someone with more experience to check if this serves our purpose.
# However I think what's more important right now is we build the actual OS, based off the Linux chassis. (I like using this term actually)
# Let's get a simple Linux foundation here and we'll start tweaking (not twerking) it to our needs.
